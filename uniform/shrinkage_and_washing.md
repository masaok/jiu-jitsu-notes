# Shrinking

Cotton tends to shrink primarily due to **heat, moisture, and mechanical action** — all of which are present in both the **washing** and **drying** processes. Here's a breakdown of their relative impact:

---

### 🔥 Hot Wash vs. Hot Dryer — Which Shrinks Cotton More?

#### **1. Hot Wash (Hot Water)**

- **Shrinkage Cause**: The fibers in cotton swell when exposed to hot water, which can cause some initial shrinkage.
- **Impact**: Moderate.
- **Details**: Hot water loosens the hydrogen bonds in the cotton fibers, allowing them to relax and reconfigure slightly. Agitation in a washing machine can also contribute, but not dramatically.

#### **2. Hot Dryer**

- **Shrinkage Cause**: The high heat of the dryer evaporates the remaining water quickly, causing the fibers to contract and tighten.
- **Impact**: **High** — this is where most shrinkage usually occurs.
- **Details**: The mechanical tumbling action + high temperature in the dryer has a much greater tightening effect on the cotton fibers compared to washing.

---

### 🧼 Summary

- **Hot dryer** = **greater shrinkage** (especially the first time it's dried).
- **Hot wash** = can contribute, but typically less than drying.

### 🛡️ How to Prevent Shrinkage

- Wash in **cold water**.
- Air dry or tumble dry on **low heat**.
- Look for **pre-shrunk cotton** garments when buying clothes.

Let me know if you want a deep dive into how different cotton blends behave too.

# Washing

When it comes to **killing bacteria in the washing machine**, **temperature plays a major role**. Here's a breakdown by temperature level:

---

### 🦠 Effectiveness of Washer Temperatures at Killing Bacteria

#### 🔵 **Cold Water (60–80°F / 15–27°C)**

- **Effectiveness**: **Low**
- **Details**: Cold water is not effective at killing bacteria or viruses. It can still clean clothes using detergent, but **germs largely survive**.
- **Best for**: Lightly soiled clothes, delicates, and energy efficiency.

#### 🟡 **Warm/Medium Water (90–110°F / 32–43°C)**

- **Effectiveness**: **Moderate**
- **Details**: Some bacteria may be weakened but **not reliably killed**. Warm water improves cleaning performance compared to cold, especially for body oils and light stains.

#### 🔴 **Hot Water (130–140°F / 54–60°C)**

- **Effectiveness**: **High**
- **Details**: Temperatures of **at least 130°F (54°C)** are needed to **kill most bacteria, viruses, and dust mites**. This is the ideal range for sanitizing laundry, especially for items like:
  - Underwear
  - Towels
  - Bed linens
  - Cloth diapers

---

### ✅ Tips for Maximum Sanitation

- **Use a laundry sanitizer or bleach** if hot water isn't an option.
- Choose a washer with a **sanitize cycle** (these can reach ~160°F / 71°C).
- **Drying on high heat** (or sun-drying) can further kill microbes.

---

### 🧪 Bottom Line

- **Hot water (130°F or above)** is best for killing bacteria.
- Cold and warm water are better for preserving fabric but won’t sanitize laundry effectively.
