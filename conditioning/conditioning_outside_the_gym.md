Jiu Jitsu world champions often engage in a **significant amount of conditioning work outside of regular BJJ classes**, but the exact volume and type can vary based on their style, goals, and stage in their competitive cycle. Here's a breakdown of what many top-level competitors do:

---

### 🏋️‍♂️ **Strength & Conditioning (S&C)**

- **Frequency**: 2–5 sessions per week.
- **Focus**:
  - **Strength Training**: Deadlifts, squats, pull-ups, presses to build general strength and durability.
  - **Explosive Power**: Olympic lifts or plyometrics to improve scrambles and takedowns.
  - **Grip Strength**: Specialized exercises like towel pull-ups, gi hangs, or rope climbs.

> Example: Gordon Ryan and other top ADCC competitors incorporate heavy weight training 3–4 times a week.

---

### 🫁 **Cardio & Endurance**

- **Frequency**: 2–4 sessions per week, depending on training load in the gym.
- **Types**:
  - **Zone 2 cardio** (easy-paced runs, cycling) for aerobic base.
  - **High-intensity intervals** to mimic the stop-start nature of rolling.
- Some champions run or swim on recovery days to stay active without more impact.

> Many Gi competitors lean toward higher aerobic capacity, while No-Gi submission grapplers favor explosiveness.

---

### 🧘 **Mobility & Recovery**

- **Daily or near-daily** routines focused on:
  - **Joint mobility** (e.g., hips, shoulders, neck)
  - **Stretching & Yoga**
  - **Breathing exercises** to regulate stress and aid performance under pressure

> Athletes like Rafael Lovato Jr. and Mikey Musumeci emphasize longevity through regular mobility work.

---

### 🧠 **Mental Conditioning**

- **Visualization**, **meditation**, and **sports psychology** are becoming more common at the top level.
- Champions often use **video review** and detailed opponent breakdowns to enhance mat IQ.

---

### 🧪 Periodization

- During **competition camp**: Focus is on peaking with sport-specific intensity, tapering off heavy lifting as the event nears.
- In **off-season**: More general S&C work to build strength, fix imbalances, and develop physical attributes.

---

### Real-World Examples

- **Andre Galvao’s athletes** at Atos often follow structured lifting + sprinting schedules alongside 2–3 jiu jitsu sessions per day.
- **Gordon Ryan** has famously emphasized lifting nearly as much as BJJ, prioritizing physical domination and injury prevention.
