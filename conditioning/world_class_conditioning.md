World-class Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) athletes typically dedicate **2-6 hours per week** to strength and conditioning (S&C), depending on their training phase, competition schedule, and individual needs. This is in addition to their technical BJJ training, which often takes up 10-20 hours weekly. Here’s a breakdown based on available insights:

- **Frequency and Duration**: Most elite BJJ athletes engage in 2-4 S&C sessions per week, each lasting 45-90 minutes. This allows for targeted work on strength, power, endurance, and mobility without compromising mat time or recovery.
- **Training Focus**:
  - **Strength and Power**: Exercises like deadlifts, squats, bench presses, and Olympic lifts (e.g., cleans) are common to build maximal strength and explosiveness. These are often done at 70-85% of one-rep max for 3-6 reps per set.
  - **Conditioning**: High-intensity interval training (HIIT), circuit training, or sport-specific drills (e.g., grip endurance, hip mobility) target BJJ’s demands. Sessions may include sprints, battle ropes, or kettlebell circuits to mimic the sport’s anaerobic bursts.
  - **Mobility and Injury Prevention**: Yoga, dynamic stretching, or mobility drills are incorporated to maintain flexibility and joint health, critical for BJJ’s grappling demands.
- **Periodization**: S&C is tailored to competition cycles. In the off-season, athletes focus on building strength (higher volume, lower intensity), while pre-competition phases emphasize power and conditioning (lower volume, higher intensity).
- **Individual Variation**: Athletes like Gordon Ryan or Andre Galvao may prioritize different S&C approaches. For example, Ryan emphasizes heavy lifting and mobility, while others may focus more on bodyweight circuits or endurance. Training is often customized based on weight class, style (e.g., guard player vs. wrestler), and injury history.
- **Recovery Balance**: Overtraining is a risk, so S&C is carefully balanced with BJJ drills, sparring, and rest. Elite athletes often work with coaches to monitor fatigue and optimize performance.

For a precise number, it varies:

- **Beginner/Intermediate Competitors**: 2-3 hours/week, focusing on general strength and conditioning.
- **World-Class Athletes**: 4-6 hours/week during peak training camps, dropping to 2-3 hours during competition weeks to prioritize technique and recovery.
