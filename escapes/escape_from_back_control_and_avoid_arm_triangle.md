# Escaping the Back While Avoiding Arm Triangle

Escaping back control in Jiu-Jitsu using the “2-on-1 and back-to-the-mat” method is a solid fundamental approach, but it does expose you to potential attacks like the head-and-arm choke (arm triangle). Here’s how to execute the escape while _minimizing the risk_ of that submission:

---

### 🧷 Step-by-Step: 2-on-1 Escape from Back Control

#### 1. **Address the choking threat**

- **Immediately get a 2-on-1 grip** on the arm that is coming across your neck (the choking arm).
- **Pull it down and across your body** to prevent the choke and limit control.
- Keep your chin tucked to protect your neck.

#### 2. **Get your back to the mat**

- Once you have control of the choking arm, **scoot your hips down** and away from their chest.
- **Rotate your body** toward the side of the arm you’re controlling — the “underhook” side.
- Your goal is to put your back flat on the mat with your shoulders pinned down, turning into your opponent’s arm.

---

### ⚠️ Preventing the Head-and-Arm Choke (Arm Triangle)

When you turn into your opponent, there’s a risk they might trap your far arm and start to set up the head-and-arm choke. To avoid this:

#### A. **Elbow Positioning**

- **Keep your far-side elbow tight to your ribs**, not flared.
- Don’t allow it to cross your centerline or get pushed up toward your head.

#### B. **Frame with your free hand**

- If your far-side arm starts getting isolated, use it to frame against their bicep or shoulder to create space.
- If they begin to close the space for the choke, **bridge up slightly** and push your elbow downward and back toward your hip.

#### C. **Timing your turn**

- Don’t turn too early — make sure you’ve nullified the choking arm first.
- If the top person has both hooks and a seatbelt, use the “trap and peel” method first before turning to avoid giving them a window to lock the choke during the transition.

---

### 🛡 Bonus Concepts

- **Double wrist control** (instead of pure 2-on-1) can also be effective, especially if they switch grips mid-control.
- If you’re late and they begin setting the choke, **bridge and look toward your trapped arm** to make space and defend the choke setup.

Would you like a visual reference or a breakdown of what to do _if_ the opponent transitions to mount while you're escaping?

# Countering the Transition to Mount

Awesome — let’s go over what to do **if your opponent transitions to mount** while you’re escaping back control using the 2-on-1 method. This situation can happen if they anticipate your escape and decide to follow you to mount instead of fighting to keep your back.

---

## 🧭 Transition Scenario: They Switch from Back Control to Mount

### 🎯 Goal:

Turn a bad situation (back control) into a more neutral one (bottom mount) _and_ set yourself up to **escape mount quickly** before they settle in.

---

## 🧷 Step-by-Step: Defending and Escaping Mount After a Back Escape

### 1. **As they follow to mount, keep your elbows tight**

- Keep your **elbows glued to your ribs**. This prevents them from getting high mount or isolating your arms.
- Avoid posting your arms straight out — this can give up a mounted armbar or shoulder trap.

### 2. **Frame and create a wedge**

- As they come up to mount, use one arm to **frame against their hip** or waist (the “hip frame”).
- The other hand can post by your head, or be ready to assist with shrimping.

### 3. **Use a bridge and shrimp combo**

- Perform a **bridge (upa)** to disrupt their balance and make them post.
- The moment they post, **shrimp your hips out to one side** (preferably toward the side where you have your framing hand).
- Slide your **bottom knee inside** to create a knee shield or recover half guard.

### 4. **Recover to half guard or closed guard**

- If you get your knee through, **slide it all the way across to reestablish guard**.
- If they shut down the full guard recovery, aim for **knee shield half guard**, which gives you more space to reset.

---

## 🛡 Key Tips to Survive and Counter

### A. **Use the momentum of the back escape**

- Their transition to mount creates a moment where **their weight shifts forward**. Time your shrimping with this movement.

### B. **Don’t get flattened**

- Once you're under mount, **immediately get on your side**. Being flat makes it harder to escape and easier for them to set up submissions.

### C. **No crossface!**

- Fight early to prevent the crossface. If they get it, it's much harder to escape. Use your top hand to **frame against their bicep or neck** and block the crossface as you shrimp.
